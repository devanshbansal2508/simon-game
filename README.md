# Simon Game

## Overview
The **Simon Game** is a simple yet fun memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, making it a great example of front-end development and interactive gameplay.

## Features
- Interactive UI with colorful buttons
- Dynamic sequence generation
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses
- Game over alert when an incorrect sequence is entered
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface
- **CSS**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity

## How to Play
1. Click the **Start** button to begin the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors that light up.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.

5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can restart to try again.
